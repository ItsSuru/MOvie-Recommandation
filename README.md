Recommandation system is used by almost every service based company.
it uses the data of review that is given to the perticular movie and no.of reviews matter here as well.
recommandation system can also be made by using behaviour of the user such as types of things he/she do, watch, play, what they are looking to buy,etc.


The data set which is used here are given with the main py file, but it doesn't include the columns name, so I gave it the names.
Also it includes some graphical analysis for better understanding of data.
It is a item similarity based recommandation system.
